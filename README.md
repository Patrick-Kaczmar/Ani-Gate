## Description
This is a full stack application built using the MERN stack. It uses the unofficial MAL API provided by JIKAN to retrieve data about anime from MyAnimeList. This app allows users to search different anime genre's and get a list of reccomended results that can then be saved to the favorites page. Users also have the ability to search for anime by name and get a list of all the series or seasons related to that title.

## Usage
To use the app you need to sign up with an email and password to get access to the rest of the site. Once you are signed in, you can use the genre buttons or the search bar to make GET requests to the JIKAN API and get a list of anime that match what you searched for. You can click the star at the bottom of each anime card to save that anime to the favorites page, and use the delete button on your saved cards to remove them from the page and database.
